### Hi there 👋

# Bio

 🍎🧑‍🎓 I discovered the development world thanks to the participation in the Apple Foundation Program in partnership with University of Naples “L’Orientale”. I have a humanistic background with a degree in Languages, Literatures and Translation which I strongly believe can be an added value to my recent skills developed at the Apple Developer Academy of Naples. In fact, I find myself at ease in multicultural environments and I love meeting new people and discovering new things about their cultures and languages. 

 📚💻 I am an enthusiast learner and I always look forward to the opportunity of learning new things. That’s why during my journey I’ve tried to learn from everyone and I’ve explored every possible study path in order to get an overall vision. 

🎶🥋 I have many hobbies and passions, I’ve been playing the guitar and the piano for many years and I also love classic and good fantasy books. I am really keen on sport and I have been practicing Judo for 7 years. I have also recently started playing Padel in local tournaments. 

✈️ 🧳 Among the things I love best, a special place is reserved to traveling. I feel lucky for having had the opportunity to travel a lot since I was a child and I am sure that every place I have been to has contributed to shape the kind of person that I am today. 

In my second year at the Academy in the Pier 🛳 Program I am the Project Manager of my team, a role that I like a lot because it gives me the chance to keep an eye on the whole development workflow and to practice my communication and organisation skills.
# Projects 
I have worked on several projects, both personal and in team in order to learn and practise with the Swift programming language and SwiftUI. Feel free to explore them!
